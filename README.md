### 👨‍💻 About me: 
I am a Full Stack Developer specializing in modern JavaScript technologies. I have extensive experience working with React, Angular, Node, and TypeScript, and I am always eager to learn about the latest web technologies and tools.

🛠️ Currently, I work for a fintech firm where I am involved in building a new application from the ground up using React & Angular.js in the frontend and Node.js in the backend. This experience has allowed me to work with cutting-edge technologies such as AWS and Docker, and to gain a deeper understanding of RESTful APIs and SQL databases.

🚀 My passion for software development stems from my desire for continuous improvement and my drive to contribute to something bigger than myself. When I am not working, I enjoy playing tennis and football, which helps me stay active and maintain a healthy work-life balance.
